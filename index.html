    Create input box with prompt question "Rock, Paper, or Scissors?"
    Make case of input not matter so that something like rOck and Rock are okay
    Store input into variable playerSelection
    Whitelist the words "rock", "paper", and "scissors"
    Create function that is a random number generator that picks a number between 1 and 3    
    If statement 
        if 1 then assign the string "Rock" to variable computerSelection
        if 2 then assign the string "Paper" to variable computerSelection
        if 3 then assign the string "Scissors" to variable computerSelection
    Function with if statement comparing playerSelection and computerSelection
        if computerSelection = playerSelection return string that says "It's a tie" 
        if computerSelection = Rock and playerSelection = Scissors then return string "You win! Rock beats scissors"
        if computerSelection = Rock and playerSelection = Paper then return string "You win! Paper beats rock"
        if computerSelection = Paper and playerSelection = Scissors then return string "You lose! Scissors beats paper"
        if computerSelection = Paper and playerSelection = Rock then return string "You lose! Paper beats rock"
        if computerSelection = Scissors and playerSelection = Paper then return string "You lose! Scissors beats paper"
        if computerSelection = Scissors and playerSelection = Rock then return string "You win! Rock beats scissors"
    Create a function called game() that loops the function 5 times
